# AIO Coding Hub Cross-Layer Specs

Rules for contracts that cross the root application's Rust backend, generated
TypeScript bindings, frontend adapters, and React UI.

## Topics

- [Codex config contract](./codex-config-contract.md): typed config fields,
  patch semantics, raw TOML validation, generated bindings, and UI behavior.
- [Gateway failover route contract](./gateway-failover-route-contract.md):
  common provider-gate ownership, Ready-provider limits, persisted attempts,
  route hops, and UI count semantics.
- [Provider account-usage query contract](./provider-account-usage-query-contract.md):
  one TanStack Query owner for automatic, timed, and forced manual refreshes,
  plus the bounded, same-origin NewAPI model-token billing protocol.
- [Provider OAuth device-flow contract](./provider-oauth-device-flow-contract.md):
  bounded Codex/Grok device responses, safe polling arithmetic, flow ownership,
  cancellation, and token persistence.
- [Config migration Skill bundle contract](./config-migration-skill-bundle-contract.md):
  bounded installed/local Skill export, Base64 serialization, import
  validation, and validation-before-write filesystem restoration.
- [Image Gen trust boundary contract](./image-gen-trust-boundary-contract.md):
  DNS-pinned redirect-safe downloads, backend-owned native saving, canonical
  history paths, DB-reference validation, and asset-scope authority.
- [Settings ownership and rollback contract](./settings-ownership-rollback-contract.md):
  lock-internal field-owned RMW, whole-snapshot CAS, and safe rollback.
- [Trellis task context archive contract](./trellis-task-context-archive-contract.md):
  exact self-reference rewriting and repository-wide context validation before archive commit.

## Pre-Development Checklist

When changing a Codex `config.toml` field:

1. Read [Codex config contract](./codex-config-contract.md).
2. Trace both read and write paths through Rust, generated bindings, the
   frontend adapter, and the consuming UI.
3. Decide separately how structured patches and full raw TOML saves handle
   unset, invalid, and future values.
4. Search for every complete `CodexConfigState` fixture before regenerating
   bindings.

When changing provider account-usage fetching:

1. Read [Provider account-usage query contract](./provider-account-usage-query-contract.md).
2. Decide whether the change affects query ownership, the remote adapter
   protocol, or both; apply every relevant scenario in that contract.
3. For query changes, trace automatic, timed, and manual entry points through
   the same query key, options, cache owner, and component state.
4. Test uncancellable IPC Promises with deliberately reversed completion order.
5. For NewAPI changes, trace Base URL normalization, same-origin endpoints,
   redirect policy, authentication headers, bounded bodies, application-error
   ordering, field/unit validation, normalization, IPC, and display together.
6. Confirm account usage remains display-only and that fixtures/specs contain
   no upstream body/message, credential, PII, live host, token name, or actual
   account amount.

When changing Codex or Grok device authorization:

1. Read [Provider OAuth device-flow contract](./provider-oauth-device-flow-contract.md).
2. Trace start and poll responses through the bounded reader, object/type and
   required-field validation, interval/expiry arithmetic, flow ownership, and
   token persistence.
3. Test pending, terminal, cancellation/replacement, and successful completion
   separately; remote bodies and tokens must not enter errors or logs.

When changing config migration Skill payload handling:

1. Read [Config migration Skill bundle contract](./config-migration-skill-bundle-contract.md).
2. Trace installed and local Skill files through bounded export, Base64,
   bundle reading, decoded validation, metadata validation, and filesystem
   activation.
3. Confirm the single-file raw cap, derived Base64 cap, and decoded total are
   symmetric across export and import.
4. Confirm path, duplicate, file-count, symlink, special-file, metadata,
   `SKILL.md`, and import-file limits remain enforced before partial output.

When changing Image Gen network or filesystem behavior:

1. Read [Image Gen trust boundary contract](./image-gen-trust-boundary-contract.md).
2. Trace remote URL hops through DNS validation and pinned connections; do not
   rely on final-URL checks after automatic redirects.
3. Keep save-dialog authorization and file writing in one Rust command; the
   renderer supplies data and a suggested filename, never a destination path.
4. Treat task dirs and stored filenames from SQLite as untrusted candidates and
   validate them against the canonical current/historical settings-owned root
   allowlist; DB content never adds a root.
5. Confirm DB content cannot expand read/delete/cleanup or asset-scope authority.

When changing a production settings writer:

1. Read [Settings ownership and rollback contract](./settings-ownership-rollback-contract.md).
2. Name the fields owned by the writer and search every production `settings::write` call.
3. Keep read, mutation, validation and write under the shared settings lock.
4. Define a committed-field token and CAS rollback for external side effects.

When changing Trellis task archive or context validation:

1. Read [Trellis task context archive contract](./trellis-task-context-archive-contract.md).
2. Keep path rewriting JSON-aware and limited to the archived task's exact `file` prefix.
3. Validate all active and archived manifests before archive auto-commit.

## Quality Check

- Regenerate and verify `src/generated/bindings.ts` from Rust source.
- Test Rust parsing, structured patching, and full-file write safety.
- Test frontend adapter defaults and the UI's null/unknown-value behavior.
- Verify unrelated patches preserve fields that they do not own.
- Run a deterministic barrier through a real production settings writer; prove
  unrelated Image Gen/Grok fields survive and CAS preserves newer owner values.
- Run focused tests, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm tauri:fmt`, and
  `pnpm check:generated-bindings`.
- When changing gateway selection or failover, verify skipped candidates,
  Ready-provider limits, route projection, and attempt/transition labels together.
- When changing account-usage refresh, verify forced fetches, late-result
  suppression, loading/error state, and provider/cache isolation together.
- When changing the NewAPI account-usage adapter, verify the public status plus
  two Bearer billing requests, trailing `/v1` normalization, same-origin and
  no-redirect rules, exact unit/formula/expiry parsing, per-response body caps,
  application-error precedence, all-or-nothing failure, and sub2api stability.
- Audit account-usage diffs for credential, PII, host, upstream-message/body,
  token-name, and actual-account-value leakage, and verify routing, circuit,
  availability, order, and enablement remain untouched.
- When changing config migration Skill payloads, verify export/import boundary
  symmetry, failure before target-directory creation or file writes, v1/v2 and
  installed/local compatibility, and file-count, total-size, Base64, path,
  symlink, cycle, special-file, metadata, and import-bundle safety negatives.
- When changing Image Gen, verify no-redirect per-hop DNS pinning, private-host
  and non-global-address negatives, body/redirect caps, URL/error redaction,
  multipart decode-before-allocation budgets, backend-owned save cancellation
  and extension checks, canonical root containment, opaque DB-reference reads,
  batch validation-before-delete, and zero Image Gen asset scope.
- When changing provider device OAuth, verify bounded authorization/token
  bodies, non-empty typed fields, bounded Result expiry arithmetic, cumulative
  RFC 8628 slow-down intervals, pending/terminal flow ownership, cancellation,
  no-persistence invalid cases, and secret-free diagnostics.
