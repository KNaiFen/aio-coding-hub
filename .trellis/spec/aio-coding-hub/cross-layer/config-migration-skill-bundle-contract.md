# Config Migration Bundle Contract

## Scenario: Change Installed Or Local Skill Payload Migration

### 1. Scope / Trigger

Use this contract when changing how a configuration bundle exports installed
or local Skill files, serializes their bytes as Base64, decodes an imported
payload, or writes the decoded files to disk.

The complete boundary is:

```text
installed/local Skill directory
  -> bounded recursive export
  -> SkillFileExport { relative_path, content_base64 }
  -> ConfigBundle JSON
  -> 64 MiB bounded import read
  -> Base64 and decoded-byte validation
  -> validated target-directory write
```

This contract does not change Skill installation, synchronization, or runtime
budgets outside configuration migration.

### 2. Signatures

The Skill filesystem entry points in
`src-tauri/src/infra/config_migrate/skill_fs.rs` are:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
pub(super) fn export_skill_dir_files(
    dir: &Path,
    skip_source_marker: bool,
) -> AppResult<Vec<SkillFileExport>>;

pub(super) fn write_skill_files_to_dir(
    dir: &Path,
    files: &[SkillFileExport],
    source_metadata: Option<&SkillSourceMetadataFile>,
) -> AppResult<()>;

pub(super) struct SkillExportRoot { /* trusted parent directory handle */ }
pub(super) struct CapturedSkillDir { /* relative/no-follow child handle */ }
pub(super) struct SkillExportBudget { /* export-scoped encoded bytes + file count */ }
```

The serialized file payload remains:

```rust
pub struct SkillFileExport {
    pub relative_path: String,
    pub content_base64: String,
}
```

The configuration import command in
`src-tauri/src/commands/config_migrate.rs` owns the bounded bundle read:

```rust
fn read_config_import_bundle_with_max_len(
    file_path: &str,
    max_len: usize,
) -> Result<config_migrate::ConfigBundle, String>;

fn read_config_import_bundle(
    file_path: &str,
) -> Result<config_migrate::ConfigBundle, String>;
```

`read_config_import_bundle` passes
`config_migrate::CONFIG_BUNDLE_ENCODED_MAX_BYTES` (alias
`CONFIG_IMPORT_FILE_MAX_BYTES`) to the bounded helper before UTF-8 and JSON
parsing. Export serialization uses the same constant. Do not introduce an
unbounded alternate reader or a second independent 64 MiB magic number.

### 3. Contracts

- The configuration bundle schema, `relative_path` representation, and
  standard Base64 field format remain unchanged.
- `CONFIG_SKILL_TOTAL_MAX_BYTES` is `8 * 1024 * 1024` and
  `CONFIG_SKILL_FILE_MAX_BYTES` explicitly equals that shared constant.
  `CONFIG_SKILL_FILE_BASE64_MAX_BYTES` is derived from the raw single-file
  limit with `CONFIG_SKILL_FILE_MAX_BYTES.div_ceil(3) * 4`; it is not an
  independent magic number.
- One Skill contains at most 256 exported files and at most 8 MiB of decoded
  file bytes in total. A relative path contains at most 512 characters.
- One `config_export` invocation creates a single `SkillExportBudget` shared by
  installed and local Skill collectors. Across both exporters it permits at
  most 56 MiB of standard-Base64 encoded file payload and at most 2048
  collected files. Per-Skill collectors do not reset this aggregate budget.
- After the bounded raw handle read and per-Skill checks, but before invoking
  the Base64 encoder, reserve the next file's exact encoded length and one file
  slot with checked arithmetic. Overflow or a limit breach returns explicit
  `SEC_INVALID_INPUT`; the file is neither encoded nor appended, no later file
  is skipped, and the production export target is not replaced.
- Source metadata remains bounded at 64 KiB and `SKILL.md` remains bounded at
  256 KiB. The complete imported configuration file and the complete exported
  pretty JSON remain bounded at 64 MiB encoded bytes. Export must fail before
  overwriting the target when serialization would exceed that budget.
- A necessary binary file larger than 1 MiB and no larger than 8 MiB must be
  carried completely. Do not skip it, truncate it, replace it, filter by
  content/sensitivity, or branch on its extension. A file of exactly 8 MiB is
  valid only when the Skill's other exported file bytes do not make the total
  exceed 8 MiB. Legal arbitrary bytes must round-trip byte-for-byte.
- Shared filesystem helpers open regular files with no-follow semantics and
  hard-bounded handle reads that consume at most `limit + 1` bytes. Skill
  export reuses the already identity-checked file handle; it does not reopen
  by path and does not `read_to_end` unbounded after metadata.
- Export bounds each file read by the shared single-file limit, then uses
  checked addition to enforce the decoded total before adding the encoded
  file to the bundle.
- Config import destructive lifecycle (canonical/runtime capture through DB
  commit, Skill FS guard finish, or complete rollback) is serialized by a
  process-level import lock. Pure payload preflight, user confirmation, and
  the 64 MiB bounded file read remain outside that lock. Stage/backup paths
  use random unique import tokens.
- Import validates file count, relative paths, duplicate paths, derived
  Base64 length, decoded single-file length, and checked decoded total before
  creating the target directory or writing any file. Import orchestration
  validates local source metadata completeness before calling the writer; the
  writer receives typed metadata only after that validation.
- Paths must remain UTF-8, non-empty, relative, component-safe, and within the
  512-character limit. Traversal and rooted or absolute paths are rejected.
- Payload paths and the generated `.aio-coding-hub.managed` and
  `.aio-coding-hub.source.json` marker paths form one preflight conflict graph.
  Exact, ancestor, or descendant collisions with either marker are rejected;
  the writer never silently removes or overwrites a payload marker.
- Path comparison follows the target platform: Windows normalizes every UTF-8
  component with stable lowercase comparison, while non-Windows keeps
  case-sensitive components. The same comparison identifies `SKILL.md`, so a
  Windows alias such as `skill.MD` receives the 256 KiB budget and cannot share
  an address with `SKILL.md`. Results are independent of payload order.
- Installed `skill_key` values are directory authority and use one shared
  import/rollback/export validator: exactly one portable `Component::Normal`.
  Separators, `.`/`..`, root/prefix, drive, UNC, and colon forms are rejected
  before staging creation. File paths also reject portable file/directory
  ancestor conflicts (`a` with `a/b`) in either input order.
- Recursive export opens the canonical Skill root once, enumerates directories
  from that handle, and opens every child relative/no-follow. Type, identity,
  size and bytes come from the same child handle; identity changes, hard links,
  symlink escapes, Windows junction/reparse points and special files fail closed.
  Visited identities may skip a symlink directory cycle, but no content is read
  through the symlink path.
- Production installed/local export opens the trusted SSOT/CLI parent root once,
  enumerates top-level entries from that handle, and opens each Skill child
  relative/no-follow with identity verification. `is_dir`, `exists`, or
  `canonicalize` results never become top-level read authority. A top-level
  symlink/junction is rejected or ignored as non-local authority, and a
  post-enumeration replacement fails closed.
- Local `SKILL.md` and source metadata are parsed from the exact bytes collected
  through the captured Skill handle in the same export pass. Do not reopen either
  file by path after classifying the directory.
- Export authority is not content policy. Every byte from a regular single-link
  file proven inside the Skill root is exported byte-for-byte, including
  credential-looking or `SYNTHETIC_SECRET` test content. Do not add sensitive-word
  scanning, filtering, omission, redaction or content blocking.
- Input and security validation failure is explicit and all-or-nothing with
  respect to validation: export does not return a partial file list, and
  import completes validation before creating the target directory or writing
  files. This does not promise directory-level transactional rollback if a
  filesystem I/O failure occurs after writing begins.
- Each atomic file write creates a randomized same-directory temporary file
  with `create_new`. Temporary cleanup removes only that writer-owned file;
  legal payload names such as `a.aio-tmp` or
  `.aio-coding-hub.source.json.aio-tmp` are never reserved or overwritten.
- `SKILL.md` uses its 256 KiB budget on export/import/restore. Source metadata
  is serialized, checked for completeness and the 64 KiB cap, and held in the
  prepared payload before any ordinary file write.
- Schema v1 continues to preserve legacy Skill state. Schema v2 continues to
  require and restore the complete installed/local Skill payload.

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: a synthetic nested `assets/fixture.png` payload is larger than 1 MiB
  but smaller than 8 MiB; export and import reproduce every synthetic byte.
- Good: one synthetic 8 MiB file and no other payload bytes completes a
  bounded round trip.
- Good: input order does not change duplicate/ancestor/marker conflict results.
- Base: small `SKILL.md` and text assets keep the existing schema, paths, and
  Base64 representation.
- Base: installed and local Skill payloads continue to round trip under schema
  v2, while schema v1 keeps its legacy preservation behavior.
- Bad: accept an 8 MiB file plus any non-empty companion file because each
  file is individually legal; the decoded Skill total still exceeds 8 MiB.
- Bad: skip a large resource by extension and emit a bundle that cannot
  reconstruct the source Skill.
- Bad: create the target directory, write early files, and only then discover
  a duplicate path, oversized decoded file, or invalid metadata.
- Bad: accept a payload marker and later delete/overwrite it while generating
  local metadata, or compare paths with raw `PathBuf` on Windows.
- Bad: describe `write_skill_files_to_dir` as a directory transaction that
  rolls back every file after an I/O failure; the helper guarantees
  validation-before-write ordering, not transactional filesystem rollback.

### 6. Tests Required

Keep focused regressions in
`src-tauri/src/infra/config_migrate/tests.rs` for:

- `1 MiB + 1` export acceptance and nested synthetic binary byte-for-byte
  round trip.
- Exactly 8 MiB acceptance and 8 MiB + 1 export/import rejection.
- Multiple individually legal files whose decoded total exceeds 8 MiB.
- Export and import rejection at 257 files.
- Base64 text above the derived cap and decoded bytes above the raw cap; both
  must prove the target directory does not exist after failure. The decoded
  case must first prove its encoded length did not exceed the precheck cap.
- Duplicate, traversal, rooted/absolute, overlong, and non-UTF-8 paths.
- Symlink escape, symlink directory cycles, and special files on platforms
  that expose those filesystem types.
- Deterministic post-enumeration file/directory replacement barriers, including
  Windows hardlink/junction, plus a root-owned sensitive-looking binary round trip.
- Real `config_export` regressions for installed and local top-level
  symlink/junction and post-parent-enumeration replacement.
- Real production-path `config_export` regressions proving installed and local
  Skills share the 56 MiB encoded and 2048-file aggregate budget. Seed a
  sentinel destination and assert both aggregate failures leave it unchanged;
  retain a `> 1 MiB && <= 8 MiB` arbitrary-byte export/import round trip.
- v1/v2 compatibility, installed/local restoration, dedicated metadata and
  `SKILL.md` bounds, and the 64 MiB import-file read boundary.
- Import/rollback `skill_key` traversal and Windows drive/UNC forms, proving no
  escaped path, staging residue, or partial DB/Skill activation.
- File/directory ancestor conflicts in both orders and metadata serialization
  overflow before target creation or ordinary file writes.
- Generated marker collisions, Windows case aliases in both orders, platform-
  specific `SKILL.md` alias budgets, and explicit non-Windows case behavior.
- Writer order tests for `a.aio-tmp` plus `a`, and a real
  `export_skill_dir_files` to `write_skill_files_to_dir` byte-for-byte round trip
  containing temporary-like names.

Run at least:

```powershell
cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml config_migrate --lib --locked
pnpm tauri:fmt
pnpm tauri:clippy
git diff --check
```

Run the full Rust library suite when production config-migration code or a
shared filesystem helper changes.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```rust
const CONFIG_SKILL_FILE_MAX_BYTES: usize = 1024 * 1024;
const CONFIG_SKILL_TOTAL_MAX_BYTES: usize = 8 * 1024 * 1024;

// Or: silently omit a large file and continue exporting.
if bytes.len() > CONFIG_SKILL_FILE_MAX_BYTES {
    return Ok(());
}
```

This creates an unsupported 1 MiB/8 MiB asymmetry and can produce an
incomplete bundle. Raising only export or only import would instead create a
bundle that one side accepts and the other rejects.

#### Correct

```rust
const CONFIG_SKILL_TOTAL_MAX_BYTES: usize = 8 * 1024 * 1024;
const CONFIG_SKILL_FILE_MAX_BYTES: usize = CONFIG_SKILL_TOTAL_MAX_BYTES;
const CONFIG_SKILL_FILE_BASE64_MAX_BYTES: usize =
    CONFIG_SKILL_FILE_MAX_BYTES.div_ceil(3) * 4;
```

Use the shared raw limit on both export and import, keep the decoded total at
8 MiB, validate the complete synthetic payload before writing, and require a
bounded byte-for-byte round trip rather than omission or truncation.

Path correctness uses one normalized component graph for payload paths,
generated markers, duplicate/ancestor checks, and `SKILL.md` classification;
do not bolt marker deletion or case handling onto the write phase.

## Follow-up Findings F10-F12

- Import rollback state must distinguish a candidate SSOT path, an import-owned
  stage directory, a live root successfully moved to backup, and an activated
  replacement root. A stage or pre-backup failure may remove only the stage;
  it must never delete the preexisting live root. A successful activation may
  remove only that activated replacement before restoring its own backup.
- A local target directory is import-owned only after it was verified absent and
  before the first mkdir/write. If a multi-file writer fails midway, rollback
  removes that new target and preserves every preexisting directory and byte.
  The writer must not silently turn a partial directory into a committed import.
- Unix handle-relative export child opens must include O_NONBLOCK together
  with O_NOFOLLOW and O_CLOEXEC, then perform the existing type, identity, and
  single-link checks. The production FIFO replacement regression must use an
  external bounded watchdog so a blocking open cannot make the test hang.

## Scenario: Account-Usage Credentials In Config Bundle V3 And Provider Identity In V4

### 1. Scope / Trigger

Use this scenario when changing config-bundle versions, provider account-usage
configuration, private NewAPI account credentials, provider restore, or config
import rollback. Whole-config backup is user-authorized sensitive export and
intentionally differs from single-provider sharing.

### 2. Signatures

```rust
pub const CONFIG_BUNDLE_SCHEMA_VERSION: u32 = 4;
pub(crate) const CONFIG_BUNDLE_FULL_SKILL_PAYLOAD_MIN_VERSION: u32 = 2;
pub(crate) const CONFIG_BUNDLE_ACCOUNT_USAGE_SNAPSHOT_MIN_VERSION: u32 = 3;
pub(crate) const CONFIG_BUNDLE_PROVIDER_UUID_MIN_VERSION: u32 = 4;

pub struct ProviderExport {
    // Existing provider fields omitted.
    pub provider_uuid: Option<String>,
    pub source_provider_uuid: Option<String>,
    pub account_usage_config: Option<serde_json::Value>,
    pub account_usage_credentials: Option<ProviderAccountUsageCredentialsExport>,
}

pub struct ProviderAccountUsageCredentialsExport {
    pub newapi_user_id: Option<String>,
    pub newapi_access_token_plaintext: Option<String>,
}

pub(crate) fn prepare_config_import(
    bundle: ConfigBundle,
) -> AppResult<PreparedConfigImport>;
```

The sensitive bundle and credential carrier types must not derive `Debug`.
Provider restoration calls `restore_account_usage_credentials` inside the
same SQLite transaction that inserts the provider and canonical extension.

### 3. Contracts

- Export always writes schema v4. It retains the v3 account-usage snapshot
  behavior and adds a canonical provider UUID for every provider plus UUID
  links for bridge sources. A v4 bundle never derives provider identity from
  numeric IDs, names, or ordering.
- Schema v4 provider UUIDs are canonical lowercase UUIDv4 values, are unique
  across the bundle, and source UUID references must resolve to a different
  provider in the same bundle. Validate these facts before any destructive
  import work.
- Account config passes through the shared extension sanitizer before leaving
  or entering the database. Private identity/token fields never remain inside
  extension JSON.
- Schema validation accepts exactly v1, v2, v3, and v4. Capability thresholds
  are feature-owned constants: complete installed/local Skill payload begins
  at v2, account config/credential snapshots begin at v3, and stable provider
  UUIDs begin at v4. Do not compare these features to the mutable current
  version constant.
- v1 preserves its legacy Skill semantics and imports no account-usage
  snapshot. v2 requires/restores full Skill payloads but still imports no
  account-usage snapshot. Even if an older-version JSON contains those optional
  fields, preparation clears them before import.
- v3 requires the established full Skill payload behavior and imports
  canonical account config plus optional credentials. Missing credential
  snapshot means the restored provider has no private account credentials.
- v4 retains the v3 account behavior and requires the provider/source UUID
  fields. On a same-machine import, local managed-model catalogs and Codex
  profile metadata may be rebound only through an exact retained provider UUID;
  they are never serialized into the bundle. A legacy v1-v3 import is rejected
  before replacement when local managed profiles exist because it cannot prove
  that identity.
- User ID normalization requires ASCII digits in `1..=i64::MAX`; token
  normalization applies the private credential size/header rules. Any invalid
  v3 snapshot fails before commit.
- Database provider replacement, account extension insertion, private
  credential restoration, and the rest of config import are atomic under the
  existing import transaction/rollback lifecycle. A credential failure leaves
  the pre-import database and private credentials intact.
- Exported v3 JSON is sensitive by design and remains under the existing
  user-facing backup warning and 64 MiB encoded bundle cap. Logs, errors,
  generated bindings, task artifacts, and test output must not print the
  credential fields or their values.
- Single-provider share must not use this snapshot. Local duplication copies
  credentials through the provider transaction rather than serializing a
  config bundle.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Bundle/input | Required result |
| --- | --- |
| Schema v1 | Legacy Skill behavior; ignore account config and credentials |
| Schema v2 with complete Skill payload | Restore Skills; ignore account config and credentials |
| Schema v2 missing required Skill payload | Reject under the existing v2 rule |
| Schema v3 with canonical config and valid credentials | Restore both in provider transaction |
| Schema v3 with no credential snapshot | Restore provider/config without a private row |
| Schema v4 with valid provider/source UUIDs | Restore v3 state and retain exact provider identity links |
| Schema v4 with missing, invalid, duplicate, or dangling UUID | Reject before destructive import |
| Schema v1-v3 while local managed profiles exist | Reject before replacing providers |
| Schema v3 has invalid/out-of-range User ID | `SEC_INVALID_INPUT`; roll back the whole import |
| Schema v3 has invalid/oversized token | `SEC_INVALID_INPUT`; roll back the whole import |
| Account config contains historical private fields | Strip them through the shared sanitizer |
| Unsupported schema version | Reject before destructive import work |
| Serialized bundle exceeds 64 MiB | Reject without replacing the export target |

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: a v3 synthetic account-mode provider exports canonical config plus a
  private snapshot and imports byte-for-byte equivalent credentials without
  exposing them through `ProviderSummary`.
- Good: an invalid v3 User ID aborts import and preserves the complete prior
  provider and private credential winner.
- Base: v2 continues to restore complete installed/local Skills exactly as
  before and ignores account snapshot fields.
- Base: v1 continues its legacy Skill preservation behavior.
- Bad: use `schema_version >= CONFIG_BUNDLE_SCHEMA_VERSION` as the Skill
  gate after the current version advances to 3.
- Bad: restore providers first, commit, then write private credentials in a
  second transaction.

### 6. Tests Required

- Assert export emits schema v4, canonical account config, stable provider
  UUIDs, and synthetic
  credentials only for providers that have private data.
- Run a v1/v2/v3/v4 matrix proving the independent Skill, account-snapshot,
  and provider-UUID capability thresholds, including v2's full Skill
  requirements.
- Round-trip v3 account mode, User ID, token, and refresh settings; assert the
  extension contains no historical private keys and summary contains no token.
- Inject out-of-range User ID, invalid token, invalid account config, and a
  later import failure; assert provider rows, private credentials, Skills, and
  other rollback-owned state preserve the pre-import winner.
- Assert sensitive carrier types do not derive `Debug` and errors/logs do not
  contain synthetic credential values.
- Keep 64 MiB bundle, Skill payload, import lock, staged filesystem, and all
  existing v1/v2 rollback regressions green; run the full Rust suite after
  production config-migration changes.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```rust
let imports_skills = schema_version >= CONFIG_BUNDLE_SCHEMA_VERSION;
let imports_account_credentials = imports_skills;
```

#### Correct

```rust
let imports_skills =
    schema_version >= CONFIG_BUNDLE_FULL_SKILL_PAYLOAD_MIN_VERSION;
let imports_account_credentials =
    schema_version >= CONFIG_BUNDLE_ACCOUNT_USAGE_SNAPSHOT_MIN_VERSION;
```

Each feature keeps the version at which it first appeared, so advancing the
current export schema cannot silently regress older bundle semantics.

## Scenario: Local Managed Model State During Config Bundle V4 Import

### 1. Scope / Trigger

Use this scenario when a full configuration import changes provider identity,
provider-model catalogs, or managed Codex profile metadata.

### 2. Contracts

- Provider-model catalogs, manual model entries, managed-profile metadata, and
  generated `$CODEX_HOME/<name>.config.toml` files remain machine-local. They
  are not exported in a config bundle.
- Before the import deletes or replaces provider rows, capture local managed
  state together with the referenced provider UUIDs in the same import lock
  and database transaction lifecycle.
- A v4 import may reinsert captured local state only when its provider UUID is
  present in the incoming bundle and remains an eligible direct Codex provider.
  Reinserted discovered entries are stale because the connection may have
  changed.
- A profile whose provider UUID is absent, no longer direct Codex, or whose
  stored Codex home no longer matches a safe resolved home blocks the import
  before the existing configuration is cleared. Report only bounded profile
  names, never a credential, URL, raw upstream body, or filesystem detail.
- Config v1-v3 does not carry stable provider identity. When any local managed
  profile exists, reject those imports before destructive work instead of
  guessing an ID/name mapping. Without local managed profiles, retain the
  existing legacy import behavior and generate fresh provider UUIDs.

### 3. Tests Required

- Cover v4 same-machine rebinding, stale discovered-state restoration, and
  local state removal for unreferenced providers.
- Cover malformed/duplicate/dangling v4 UUIDs and every profile-rebinding
  rejection before provider deletion.
- Cover v1-v3 import with and without local managed profiles, and prove no
  catalog/profile row or profile file enters export bytes.
